SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Nice work here, looks like everything is working for you.

If you got a warning about using "gets()" when you compiled your
   "sayhelloplus.c" program, try using a different function.  Look up
   the "C" functions on the Internet and see if you can find something
   else to use, like "scanf()" or "fgets()" or something else.

As a challenge to yourselves, see if you can find a different way of reading
   values from the user.  There are several different ways of doing that, so
   do a little research to see what else is available.

For formatting, in your "C" code, the "int main" should start at the left
   margin, like the "#include" lines do.  In your nasm code, try to make the
   only things that start at the left margin be the labels, and everything
   else be indented and aligned.  The "global" and "extern" keywords should
   be aligned with the mnemonics.

Off to a great start!
