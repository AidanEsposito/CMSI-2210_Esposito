What is a computer system?

The computer system is the total collection of hardware and software for a computer ran by the CPU and other computer parts
and applications.

What are some of the parts of a computer system?


Some of the different parts of a computer system are the CPU, gates, chips, integrated circuits, memory,
storage blocks, and other bits of circuitry. 


What is the difference between a compiled language and an intepreted language?


The difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language is that a compiled language needs a compiler software tool
to translate the code for the computer to understand while an interpreted language uses the computer to interprete and translate
executable code.


Is C a compiled language?

The coding language C is a compiled language but it stands out in the sense that it lacks a virtual machine therefore the code
written is made directly into binary for the computer to use with low level operating systems.


Who invented the C language?


The C language was invented by Dennis M. Ritchie, a computer scientist working at Bell Laboratories in the 1970's.

How long has C been in use?

The programming language C has been used since the early 1970's. The language only widely became used in the 1980's
as its popularity increased.

Is a compiler a translator?


The compiler is a translator for compiled language as it allows source code in a language to be translated to 
assembly language for a computer to run in low level operating systems.


Is an assembler a translator?


An assembler is a translator for a computer in which after source code is translated with a compiler to assembly code,
The assembler translates the language to machine code for the CPU, the interprator, to run.


What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?


The command to list out contents of a directory in a mac terminal is the ls command. This command can be added onto
with a directory or path to list a specific directory and its content.


What does the C function atof() do?


The C function atof() is used change and convert a string to a floating point number for use in variables or other situations.

What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.


The bottom two layers of a computer system are the Control layer and the Digital Logic layer. The digital logic level relates
to the actual hardware of the computer which is implemented through circuits, motherboards, chips, and other hardware pieces.
The control layer above it uses the hardware below and contains the microcode that the hardware uses to run. 


What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?

The three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture are the steps of Fetch, Decode, and Execute.


What is the purpose of an ALU?


The purpose of an ALU is to execute decoded instructions given from the control unit in the CPU. The ALU also 
pushes its results to the main memory or another registry.


What is a register?


The register in a CPU is used to keep track of an instructions address from the memory of a computer. 
It is also used to decode instructions for the ALU to run via fetches from main memory to get data.


What is one difference between Application software and System software?


One difference between Application software and System software is that Application software is designed for humans and deals
with human-centered abstractions like customers, products, users, etc. System software is designed for computers and 
deals with computer-centered concepts such as registers and memory locations.


Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?


The phrase cmp rdi, rsi is not machine language but instead assembly language made by a compiler. This assembly language
needs to be converted to machine language with binary for the computer to actually understand it.


How many buses are included in the system bus?


There are three buses that are included in the system bus. The first bus is the data bus which carries data to be transferred
between the CPU and main memory or CPU and input/output controller of the computer. The second bus is the address bus
which allows the CPU to access other system parts by creating an address for data from the data bus and lets the system know
where the data needs to be. Finally, the third bus is the control bus which allows parts of the system to interact by raising 
or lowering lines on the bus.


What is the decimal value of 100101112?


The decimal value of 100101112 would be non existant as binary is only made out of 0's and 1's and therefore could
not be converted to decimal because there is a 2 in the supposed binary number.


What is the decimal value of 111111112?


The decimal value of 111111112 would also be non existant because of the 2 present in the binary number.


What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?


The largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits is the 16 bit value of 65535.
