TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 83.00/100.00 which is 83% which is a B

SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD.nasm: assembles, links, and runs.  However, I get no output
   either for a prompt of what to do, or the GCD for the two numbers.  There
   is no code to put out the prompt, and you are pushing the values for the
   _scanf call out of order ~ the format should be pushed last.  Still, not
   bad.

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c: assembles but won't link.  I see
   that you didn't provide the underscore in the assembly code for the name
   of the function.  I fixed that for you.  However, it still doesn't link,
   with the error 'undefined reference to findGCD'.

problem 3 paritygen.nasm: perfect

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c: perfect

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c: compiles, links, and runs [although
   not with the commands provided!] but doesn't actually swap the byte
   order.

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm: compiles and assembles, but won't link
   so I can't run it.

SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework04 ~  96.67% of  5 points =  4.83 points
   homework05 ~  98.00% of 10 points =  9.80 points
   homework06 ~  83.00% of 15 points = 12.45 points
                       semester total: 42.08 out of 45.00 = 93.51%
                             which is a solid A

Great work!  You've worked hard on this material and it shows.  Keep up
the good work and I look forward to seeing you in future classes!  It's
been a pleasure having you in class.
